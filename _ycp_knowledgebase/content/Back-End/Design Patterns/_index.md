The back-end application applies a few common design patterns: Factories, Adapters, and Wrappers. Each of these design patters are explained rather well by [Sourcemaking](https://sourcemaking.com/design_patterns/structural_patterns), which is an excellent reference for different kinds of design patterns.

Specifically consider familiarizing yourself with the following sources:

* [Factory](https://sourcemaking.com/design_patterns/factory_method)
* [Adapter](https://sourcemaking.com/design_patterns/adapter)
* [Decorator/Wrapper](https://sourcemaking.com/design_patterns/decorator)
