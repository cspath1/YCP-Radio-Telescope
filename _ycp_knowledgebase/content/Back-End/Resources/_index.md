Here you'll find a brief overview of technologies used in the Radio Telescope back-end application.

## REST
If you're not familiar with at least the basics of REST API design, read [here](https://restfulapi.net/).

## Kotlin
If you're new to Kotlin, a great way to learn the syntax is [Kotlin Koans](https://try.kotlinlang.org), 
essentially a web-based sandbox environment.

## Gradle
The backend app is managed with Gradle. If you're not familiar, you can [get started here](https://docs.gradle.org/current/userguide/tutorial_using_tasks.html).
